### Adding the latest Ember version

When a new version of Ember is released (for example, version 3.20), we need to manually update this app. Let's look at how to provide information on version number, features, and deprecations.

First, we add the version number to the `VERSIONS` array:

```javascript
// app/models/versions.js

export const VERSIONS = Object.freeze([
  '1.0 Prerelease',
  ...
  '3.19',
  '3.20', // <-- new!
]);
```

Next, we use custom blueprints to create Markdown files that can list features and deprecations for Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI.

```bash
ember generate upgrade-ember-model 3.20
ember generate upgrade-data-model 3.20
ember generate upgrade-cli-model 3.20
```

Each Markdown file, by default, lists 1 deprecation and 1 feature:

```markdown
---
version: "3.20"
changes:
  -
    deprecation: true
    title: ""
    link: ""
  -
    feature: true
    title: ""
    link: ""
---
```

If the release has no deprecations (or no features), you can delete the default item. If the release has more than 1 deprecation (or more than 1 feature), you can copy-paste the default item to list all. 

For example, Ember CLI v3.20 has 2 deprecations and 1 feature. The Markdown file looks like,

```markdown
---
version: '3.20'
changes:
  -
    deprecation: true
    title: "Usage on Node 13 will now issue a warning"
    link: "https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/07/29/ember-3-20-released.html"
  -
    deprecation: true
    title: "Usage of PACKAGER is deprecated"
    link: "https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/07/29/ember-3-20-released.html"
  -
    feature: true
    title: "Syncing Blueprints"
    link: "https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/07/29/ember-3-20-released.html"
---
```

⚠️ Please note that the value of `version` must be a string.
