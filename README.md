### Code Generators

Make use of the many generators for code, try `ember help generate` for more details

### Adding the latest Ember version 
To add new versions of Ember use the following commands in your terminal:

```ember generate upgrade-ember-model X.XX```
```ember generate upgrade-data-model X.XX```
```ember generate upgrade-cli-model X.XX```

You will have to manually add the new version to the VERSIONS array
```/upgrade-guide/app/models/versions.js```

The structure of generated markdown files is as follows:

```
---
version: "3.20"
changes:
  -
    deprecation: true
    title: ""
    link: ""
  -
    feature: true
    title: ""
    link: ""
---
```

If the release has no features or depresaions feel free to delete that section. If it has multiple deprecations/features you will need to manually copy paste those sections. 

For example:

```
---
version: ""
changes:
  -
    deprecation: true
    title: ""
    link: ""
  -
    deprecation: true
    title: ""
